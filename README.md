## 🏐 Overview

This project focuses on recognizing complex group activities in volleyball games by analyzing the temporal dynamics and spatial relationships between multiple players. The system can identify various volleyball-specific group activities such as right/left team spikes, sets, passes, and winning points.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Group Activity Recognition in sports videos is challenging because it requires:
- Understanding individual player actions
- Modeling temporal dependencies across frames
- Capturing spatial relationships between multiple players
- Recognizing coordinated team activities

## 🏗️ Architecture

The implementation includes **8 different baseline models** that progressively increase in complexity:

### Model Variants

| Model | Description | Architecture | Test Accuracy |
|-------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Baseline 1** | Simple ResNet-50 | Single CNN for frame-level classification | **74.83%** |
| **Baseline 3A** | Feature extraction model | ResNet-based feature extractor for individual actions | **78.27%** |
| **Baseline 3B** | Enhanced feature model | Improved version of 3A with better feature representation | **82.12%** |
| **Baseline 4** | Temporal modeling | LSTM-based temporal sequence modeling | **81.08%** |
| **Baseline 5** | Multi-stream approach | Multiple input streams for different modalities | **83.40%** |
| **Baseline 6** | Attention mechanism | Attention-based temporal modeling | **77.86%** |
| **Baseline 7** | Hierarchical modeling | Multi-level temporal and spatial modeling | **86.46%** |
| **Baseline 8** | Advanced LSTM | Dual LSTM with team-based aggregation | **89.08%** |

### Key Components

- **Feature Extraction**: Uses pre-trained ResNet models to extract 2048-dimensional features from player bounding boxes
- **Temporal Modeling**: LSTM networks to capture sequential dependencies
- **Spatial Aggregation**: Team-based feature aggregation for group activity recognition
- **Multi-level Classification**: Hierarchical approach from individual actions to group activities

## 📊 Dataset & Annotations

The system works with volleyball video datasets containing:
- **Individual Actions**: 9 action classes (waiting, setting, digging, falling, spiking, blocking, jumping, moving, standing)
- **Group Activities**: 8 group activity classes (r_spike, r_set, r-pass, r_winpoint, l-spike, l_set, l-pass, l_winpoint)
- **Player Tracking**: Bounding box annotations for each player across video frames
- **Temporal Segmentation**: Video clips annotated with group activity labels

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13.7+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (Python package manager)
- CUDA (recommended for training)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd volleyball
```

2. Install uv (if not already installed):
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

3. Install dependencies using uv:
```bash
uv sync
```

This will automatically:
- Create a virtual environment
- Install all dependencies from `pyproject.toml`
- Set up the project for development

### Project Configuration

The project uses modern Python packaging with `pyproject.toml`:

- **Dependencies**: PyTorch, torchvision, Pillow, matplotlib, scikit-learn
- **Python Version**: 3.13.7+
- **Code Quality**: Ruff for linting and formatting
- **Package Manager**: uv for fast dependency resolution

## 🔧 Usage

### 1. Feature Extraction

Extract deep features from video frames using pre-trained models:

```bash
uv run python extract_features.py
```

This script:
- Loads video frames and player bounding boxes
- Crops individual player regions
- Extracts 2048-dimensional features using Baseline 3A model
- Saves features for training/validation/test splits

### 2. Training Models

Train any of the 8 baseline models:

```bash
# Train Baseline 1 (ResNet-50)
uv run python trainers/train_b1.py

# Train Baseline 8 (Advanced LSTM)
uv run python trainers/train_b8.py
```

### 3. Model Evaluation

Models are automatically evaluated on test sets during training, generating:
- Confusion matrices for training and validation
- Loss and accuracy curves
- F1 scores and classification metrics
